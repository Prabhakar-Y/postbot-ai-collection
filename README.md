# Postbot AI

Postbot AI is a framework for automated API testing using Postman collections. This README provides detailed instructions on setting up and using Postbot AI.

## Request Types Used

Postbot AI supports various types of HTTP requests, which are essential for comprehensive API testing:

1. **GET Requests**: Used to retrieve data from the server. These requests are commonly used to test endpoints that fetch data or query information.

2. **POST Requests**: Used to submit data to the server. These requests are typically used for creating new resources or performing operations that require sending data to the server.

3. **PUT Requests**: Used to update existing resources on the server. These requests are used when modifying the data of existing resources is necessary.

4. **DELETE Requests**: Used to remove resources from the server. These requests are used to test endpoints responsible for deleting data or resources.

## Using Postbot AI to Generate Tests

Here are three key steps to efficiently use Postbot AI for generating tests:

1. **Design Test Scenarios**: Define the test scenarios based on the API endpoints you want to test. Identify different cases such as successful responses, error handling, and edge cases. Create a Postman collection that includes these scenarios.

2. **Export and Configure Collections**: Export your Postman collection and environment settings. Ensure that the collection includes all necessary test cases and that the environment variables are properly set up to reflect different testing contexts.

3. **Run and Validate Tests**: Use Postbot AI to execute the tests defined in your Postman collection. Validate the results by reviewing the generated reports and ensure that all test cases pass as expected. Adjust and refine your tests based on the results and feedback.

## Best Practices

### Using Environment Variables

- **Base URL Management**: Define the base URL for your API in environment variables. This allows you to easily switch between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) without modifying the Postman collection.

  ```json
  {
    "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com"
  }
